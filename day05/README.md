# Day 5
The description here is pretty long, but all in all it's just binary encoding 
of numbers! Just replace F/B with 1/0, and L/R with 1/0, then parse as binary.

This should be all available in the standard library.

So, we know we'll want a function that replaces F/B with 1/0, and then just 
translate that to an int.
